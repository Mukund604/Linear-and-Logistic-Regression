## Introduction

This repository provides Python implementations for Linear Regression and Logistic Regression models, fundamental algorithms in machine learning.

## File Description

- `linear_regression.py`: Python script implementing the Linear Regression model.
- `logistic_regression.py`: Python script implementing the Logistic Regression model.

## Usage

To utilize these implementations:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Mukund604/Regression-Models.git
    ```

2. Ensure Python is installed along with necessary libraries, particularly numpy.

3. Import the desired class (`LinearRegression` or `LogisticRegression`) from the respective Python script into your Python environment or Jupyter Notebook.

4. Create an instance of the class and employ the `fit` method to train the model with your training data.

5. Use the `predict` method to generate predictions on new data points.
